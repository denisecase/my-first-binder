## Exploring Modern Tools for Data Analytics

Jupyter Notebooks offer a powerful tool for telling data stories, but installing Python locally can be challenging. 
Try things out in a browser first, and then, once comfortable with Notebooks, install Anaconda locally.

Jupyter stands for Julia, Python, and R, three popular programming languages for working with data. 

Jypyter notebooks run in the browser, and let us present formatted results and charts along with our code. 

## Key Concepts

There are some key concepts to get started. 

- GitHub is a cloud provider that offers a place to store our code. 
- Git is a version control system that keeps track of changes in our code and helps us sync projects between a cloud repository like one stored in GitHub and a folder on our local machine. 
- A repository (also called "repo") is a place or folder that holds information about a coding project. A repo can have many files, and may use subfolders to organize complex projects. 
- This repo includes this README.md file, a simple Python script file (hello.py), and a Python notebook file (first-notebook.ipynb).
- The repo is stored under my GitHub user account "denisecase".
- The repo is named "my-first-binder"
- The repo URL is <https://github.com/denisecase/my-first-binder>
- Binder is a cloud service that will "host" our project / notebook and run it for free. 

## Languages Used in this Project

- Python is the programming language used for working with data
- Markdown is the name of a "markup" language used for formatting text.

## File Extensions Indicate File Type

- Python script files typically have a .py file extension. See hello.py.
- Python Jupyter notebook files typically have a .ipynb file extension. See first-notebook.ipynb.
- Markdown files typically have a .md file extension. See this file, README.md. 

Note: In programming, capitalization matters. Syntax matters. For best results:

- Never use spaces in folder names, file names, or repo names. 
- Follow all naming conventions. Do not deviate or you may encounter unexpected results. 

## How it Works

- We create and edit files in our GitHub repo. 
- We go to Binder - visit <https://mybinder.org/>
- We provide the URL of our repo to Binder and click "Launch". 
- When Binder opens, locate the desired notebook (.ipynb) file and open it in Binder. 
- Look for the "play" icon to run the file or select "Run" from the menu to execute the code and run the notebook. 

## Working with Notebooks 

Each cell in the notebook will be Python (by default) or Markdown if we indicate it by starting with %md.

- run all cells in a notebook with the arrow (run) icon. 
- run a single cell with CTRL Enter

## Saving your Work

= Binder reads & runs, but does not have permissions to write to your GitHub repo.
- When ready to save changes, you'll do it manually. 
- Click the download icon above your .ipynb file and save your file to a place on your local computer (remember where you put it). 
- Open a new browser tab to your GitHub cloud repo (e.g., https://github.com/denisecase/my-first-binder)
- Click "Add Files" / "Upload Files" and file your file to bring it into your GitHub repo.
