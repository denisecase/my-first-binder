## Exploring Modern Tools for Data Analytics

Jupyter Notebooks offer a powerful tool for telling data stories, but installing Python locally can be challenging. 
Try things out in a browser first, and then, once comfortable with Notebooks, install Anaconda locally.

Jupyter stands for Julia, Python, and R, three popular programming languages for working with data. 

Jypyter notebooks run in the browser, and let us present formatted results and charts along with our code. 

## Managing Code

Notebooks, like all code, typically evolve over time. 

- GitHub is a cloud provider that offers a place to store our code. 
- Git is a version control system that keeps track of changes in our code and helps us sync projects between GitHub cloud storage (the "origin") and a folder on our local machine. 
- A repository (also called "repo") is a place to hold information about a single coding project. It can have many files, and may use subfolders to organize complex projects. 
- This repo includes this README.md file and a Python notebook file. 

This Notebook uses:

- Python for working with Data
- Markdown for formatting
- Jypter notebook files typically have a .ipynb file extension.
- Markdown files typically have a .md file extension

Each cell in the notebook will be Python (by default) or Markdown if we indicate it by starting with %md.

- run all cells in a notebook with the arrow (run) icon. 
- run a single cell with CTRL Enter
